## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains anonymized financial and demographic features. Each row represents a customer, and the target label indicates whether their credit was approved (`1`) or not (`0`).

### üìå Features:

## üîß Preprocessing Steps

* Replaced missing values represented by `?`

  * Categorical: replaced with **mode**
  * Numerical: replaced with **mean**
* Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`

  * One encoder saved per categorical column
* Standardized column order and removed unnecessary fields (e.g., ZipCode)

---

## ü§ñ Model Training

Used **Random Forest** or **Decision Tree** classifier from `scikit-learn`.

### Metrics Evaluated:

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)

## üîÆ Predicting a New Customer

To predict credit approval for a new customer:

1. Prepare a dictionary of raw input values (like `'a'`, `'t'`, etc.).
2. Load saved encoders and model.
3. Preprocess input using the **same encoders**.
4. Align feature columns and predict.

### Example:

```python
new_customer = {
    "Gender": "a",
    "Age": 30,
    "Debt": 2.5,
    "Married": "u",
    "BankCustomer": "g",
    "EducationLevel": "q",
    "Ethnicity": "v",
    "YearsEmployed": 1.5,
    "PriorDefault": "f",
    "Employed": "t",
    "CreditScore": 10.0,
    "DriversLicense": "t",
    "Citizen": "g",
    "ZipCode": 0,
    "Income": 10000
}
```

Run the script or use a helper function to return:

```
‚úÖ Credit Approved
```

or

```
‚ùå Credit Not Approved
```
